wannabe node thing someday &lt;3

_______________________________________________________________________________

When I program something, or at least try, I always end up at some big roadblock.
That's just what developers have to overcome, we solve problems. 

To become a better programmer I want to write this program which allows the user to add nodes and also move, add, group and edit them.
They will not be part of any big system or doing much more than that.

It's just a visualizer for node trees, hopefully, one day, in a lifetime.
